Network Intrusion is a serious problem that is faced today. This project focuses on detection of anomalies in datasets containing data about network traffic from remote and local ISPs. Two datasets were obtained from different sources. An intrusion detection system is built using various Machine Learning algorithms. The project focuses on analysing various Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms , comparing them on the metric of their accuracy which deems them relatively fit to build an Intrusion Detection System.
